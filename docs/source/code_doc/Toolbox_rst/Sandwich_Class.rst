Toolbox.Sandwich class
=====================

Main principle:
--------------
A sandwich is made up out of two face sheets, which are Laminate objects in this code, as well as a core,
which is a Core object in this code. The sandwich can have load intensities assigned, which are subdivided
into the face sheets of the panel. First ply failure can be assessed for each face sheet, and dimpling and
wrinkling failure modes can also be assessed.

A Sandwich object can be used by the Member class as the 'panel' attribute.

Wrinkling (not yet dimpling) equations are obtained from the book 'Design and analysis of composite structures'
authored by Dr. Christos Kassapoglou.
