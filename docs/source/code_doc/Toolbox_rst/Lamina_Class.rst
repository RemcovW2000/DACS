Toolbox.Lamina class
=====================

Main principle:
--------------
A lamina is a single ply of cured composite material. It can be both unidirectional as well as
multidirectional (in the case of a woven fabric ply). The lamina object can have load intensities
assigned, and the critical load intensity at failure can be calculated. The failure indicator can be
calculated which is the applied load intensity, divided by the critical load intensity. The failure
model used in this code is the Puck failure model, which is industry standard.
