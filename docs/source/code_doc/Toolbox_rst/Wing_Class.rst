Toolbox.Wing class
==================

Main principle:
--------------
This class is used to build and subsequently analyse entire wings. The analysis is
done by creating airfoil objects at different stations along the half span of the
wing. Assigning the correct coordinates for the top and bottom surfaces of the
airfoil, as well as the internal loads at that station, and assigning the correct
members for the top, bottom, and the spars, as well as optionally a reinforcement
material.
